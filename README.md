# GoogleBooksSearch
A new React-based Google Books Search app. Create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## What is This?
This is a memorization/click game. The object of the game is to click on only one picture once. If you repeat guesses, you lose and the score is reset to 0. You win by reaching the max score total of 12.
